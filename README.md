# Google Books Search Engine

## Description

The Google Books Search Engine is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can save books to their personal account, view their saved books, and remove books from their collection. This application has been refactored to utilize a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server, replacing the original RESTful API.

This project demonstrates the integration of a GraphQL API with a React front end and a MongoDB back end. It also includes user authentication features, enabling users to create accounts, log in, and securely save their book searches.
